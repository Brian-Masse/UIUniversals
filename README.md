# **UIUniversals**

UIUniversals is a collection of custom swift & swiftUI views, viewModifiers and extensions. They are meant to be functional and styled views out of the box, however they still boast high customization and flexibility to fit into a variety of apps and projects.

All components were created and are actively maintained by me, Brian Masse. If you have any question or suggestions, contact me at brianm25it@gmail.com

This README serves as documentation for the package. In addition to this document, descriptions of each component can be found in inline comments in the package itself. Additionally, I created a demonstration project here to show how to contextually use this package, however not all features of the package are displayed in that project.
